# HOOPRZ

An app for practising React

![UI](src/assets/hooprz_app.png)

# Images

I've downloaded images of players using [elhanarinc](https://github.com/elhanarinc/nbaphotocrawler)'s awesome crawler than turn them into 8bit-like images using [pixelator](http://pixelatorapp.com/)

# Backend 

I've implemented a real quick proxy to [ball don't lie API](https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction) then match the images with players.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
